* Honey production by state
* Honey production by county
* Indiana honey production by county

* Honey value by state
* Honey value by county
* Indiana honey value by county

* Bee colony inventory by state
* Bee conony inventory by county
* Indiana bee colony inventory by county

## Analysis to Run
* Change in honey production by state
* Change in honey value by state from
* Change in bee colony inventory from
* Change in bee colony loss from
* Change in acres bearing almonds

* Coorelate almond production to decrease in bee production

## Machine Learning
- insert image
- supervised vs unsupervised - why we choose one technique over the other?
- do not overfit or underfit the data
- need a measure of fitness (R2)
- understand difference between precision and accuracy
- if using linear regression, use lots of scatter plots and lines
- multi-regression (a lot vs. one)
