# <p align="center">Do We Have a Plan BEE? :bee: Analyzing 30 Years of Honey Data</p>

A data analysis attempting to explain a reduction in the bee population

# <p align="center"> ![HTML CSS Code Screen Shot](images/website_screen_shot.jpeg) </p>

## Questions to Answer?
- Over the last 30 years, is bee production increasing or decreasing?
- Over the last 30 years, is the value of honey production increasing or decreasing?
- What are the top honey producing states and counties?
- What are the top honey producing counties in Indiana?
- Has almond acres bearings changed as honey production has changed?


## Obtain Data

# <p align="center"> ![HTML CSS Code Screen Shot](images/USDAscreenShot.png) </p>


## Data Sets to Collect (2017, 2012, 2007, 2002 - census years)
- Data from the USGS is grouped into two programs, with the Census program being more robust:
  - 1) Census - collected once every five years (2017, 2012, 2007, 2002)
  - 2) Survey - collected every year since 1987.
- Honey production by state, county, and Indiana county
- Honey value by state, county, and Indiana county
- Bee colony inventory by state, county, and Indiana county
- Bee colony loss by state, county, and Indiana county
- Acres bearing almonds by state

## **E**xtract**T**ransform**L**oad (ETL) the data
- Utilizing Jupyter Notebook/Lab, utilize pandas to load and clean USDA honey data.

## Analysis to Run
- Change in honey production by state
- Change in honey value by state from
- Change in bee colony inventory from
- Change in bee colony loss from
- Change in acres bearing almonds

- Coorelate almond production to decrease in bee production


## HTML / CSS
- Utilizes Sass, a powerful professional grade CSS extension library. Sass allows for nesting, variables, and imports to create a neat and simple style sheet.
- Several advanced CSS animations including a pure CSS popup.
- A bio section with several open clickable links per contributor.

## Machine Learning
- Supervised vs unsupervised - why we choose one technique over the other?
- Do not overfit or underfit the data
- Need a measure of fitness (R2)
- Understand difference between precision and accuracy
- If using linear regression, use lots of scatter plots and lines
- Multi-regression (a lot vs. one)


## Tableau
- A ![Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/michael.davis5317#!/vizhome/Do_We_Have_A_Plan_Bee/HoneyStory?publish=yes) was created that consists of nine different dashboards, which are all incorporated into one easy to understand story.
- Our story is a combination of graphs, charts, and interactive maps.

## Conclusions
- As almond production has gone up, honey production has gone down
- As honey production has gone down, honey value has gone up
- North and South Dakota account for nearly one-third of all honey production in the United States
