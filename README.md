# <p align="center">Do We Have a Plan BEE? :bee: Analyzing 30 Years of Honey Data</p>

A data analysis attempting to explain a reduction in the bee population

# <p align="center"> ![HTML CSS Code Screen Shot](images/website_screen_shot.jpeg) </p>

## Questions to Answer?
* Over the last 30 years, is bee production increasing or decreasing?
* Over the last 30 years, is the value of honey production increasing or decreasing?
* What are the top producing honey production states and counties?
* What are the top producting honey production counites in Indiana?
* Has almond acres bearings changed as honey production has changed?


## Obtain Data

## Data Sets to Collect (2017, 2012, 2007, 2002 - census years)
* Honey production by state, county, and Indiana county
* Honey value by state, county, and Indiana county
* Bee colony inventory by state, county, and Indiana county
* Bee colony loss by state, county, and Indiana county
* Acres bearing almonds by state

## **E**xtract**T**ransform**L**oad (ETL) the data
- Utilizing Jupyter Notebook/Lab, utilize pandas to load and clean USDA honey data.
- insert image - section of code showing ETL

## Analysis to Run
* Change in honey production by state
* Change in honey value by state from
* Change in bee colony inventory from
* Change in bee colony loss from
* Change in acres bearing almonds

* Coorelate almond production to decrease in bee production

## Machine Learning
- insert image
- supervised vs unsupervised - why we choose one technique over the other?
- do not overfit or underfit the data
- need a measure of fitness (R2)
- understand difference between precision and accuracy
- if using linear regression, use lots of scatter plots and lines
- multi-regression (a lot vs. one)


## Tableau

## Conclusions
- As almond production has gone up, honey production has gone down
- As honey production has gone down, honey value has gone up
